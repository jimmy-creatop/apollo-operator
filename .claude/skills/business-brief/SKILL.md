# Business Brief (Level 0.5)

Turn scattered knowledge about a business into one readable file, `brief.md`, that a person or an agent can read once and immediately understand: who the business is, what it sells, who buys it, why they buy, what proof exists, and how buyers actually talk. Every downstream skill gets sharper because this file exists. Searches target the right people, copy says something true, and objections get answered instead of ignored.

This is where context enters the system. `apollo-icp-builder` turns the brief into targeting. `apollo-sequence-builder` turns it into copy. Without a brief, both are guessing.

## When to use

- Setting up outbound for a business that has no `brief.md` yet. Run this before `apollo-icp-builder`.
- Onboarding an agent (or a new teammate) onto an existing Apollo account.
- The copy keeps coming out generic. That is a context problem, not a writing problem.
- Refreshing after something material changes: a new case study, a new offer, a repositioning.

## Principle

Read `references/outbound-principles.md` if you have not. The one that drives this skill: outbound is a system game, and account knowledge is part of the system. A brief that compounds beats a memory that resets every session.

Two rules of the brief itself:

- **It is an internal document, not marketing.** It records what is true, including weaknesses, lost deals, and real objections. A brief that reads like the website is a failed brief.
- **Never invent.** Every claim traces to a source: the website, a document the operator shared, or their own answers. What you do not know gets marked `[TBD]`, never filled with plausible fiction.

## Relationship to `profile.yaml`

Two layers, two jobs:

- **`brief.md` is the narrative layer and the source of truth** for who the business is, what it sells, why buyers buy, proof, and voice. Humans read it. Agents read it first.
- **`profile.yaml` is the machine layer**: Apollo filter sets, scoring signal definitions, saved IDs. Skills parse it.

When they disagree, the brief wins. Update the yaml to match, not the other way around.

## Process

### 1. Collect what already exists

Before reading anything, ask the operator for context you cannot see: pitch decks, case studies, sales call transcripts, onboarding docs, past campaign copy, positioning docs, a Notion page, anything. People always have more context than they think to share, and the brief is only as good as what goes in. Do not start drafting until you have asked.

### 2. Read the website

Home, product or services pages, pricing, case studies, and customer pages. Extract what they sell, who the named customers are, what claims and numbers they publish, and the exact language they use. The website is the floor of the brief, not the ceiling: it shows how the business presents itself, and hides everything else.

### 3. Interview the gaps

One batched round of questions, only for what steps 1 and 2 did not answer. The high-yield ones:

- What do you actually sell, in one sentence, and what does it cost (roughly, or the pricing model)?
- Who are your three best customers, and what made them great?
- What deals have you lost, and why?
- What is the objection you hear most, and what is your honest answer to it?
- What proof do you have with numbers in it?
- What would you never say, and what words do your buyers use that outsiders get wrong?

Do not interrogate. Batch the questions, take the answers, move on.

### 4. Draft the brief

Write `brief.md` following `references/brief-template.md`. Plain language, short sections, specific over complete. A one-page brief that is all true beats a five-page brief padded with guesses. Mark every gap `[TBD]`.

### 5. Get the human pass

The operator reads the draft and corrects it. The corrections are the most valuable content in the whole process ("we never say automation, we say workflow"; "that case study is stale, use this one"). Fold every correction in.

### 6. Sync `profile.yaml`

Derive or update the `business:` and `voice:` blocks of `profile.yaml` from the finished brief. If a profile already exists and disagrees with the brief, flag the mismatch to the operator, then align the yaml to the brief. Hand off to `apollo-icp-builder` to turn the "who buys" section into a validated Apollo search.

## Output

One `brief.md` at the project root, next to `profile.yaml`, following the template. Updated `business:` and `voice:` blocks in `profile.yaml`. A dated line in the brief's changelog saying what changed.

## Common mistakes

- Writing marketing copy instead of an internal document. The brief admits weaknesses; the website does not.
- Inventing proof points or customer names to fill a section. `[TBD]` is a correct answer.
- Skipping the interview because the website "covered it." Websites never contain lost deals or real objections, and those write the best emails.
- Duplicating targeting mechanics into the brief. Filter sets and scoring signals live in `profile.yaml` (Level 1), the brief describes who buys and why in prose.
- Letting the brief go stale. New case study, new offer, new pricing: update the brief the week it happens, and date the change.
